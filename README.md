## `ABOUT`

This repository contains almost all the `basic` Shell scripts that I have created. It also includes the scripts from my [University](https://kiit.ac.in/) LABS, and the ones I practiced or tested certain things on.

## `PLATFORM AND COMPILER USED`

[gedit](https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/)  Text Editor was used on a Kali Linux, to create these scripts.
